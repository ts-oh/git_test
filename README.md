This is Tim's first git project!!!

Regarding the specific commands weâ€™ve covered:
For git amend never amend commits that have been pushed to remote repositories.
For git rebase never rebase a repository that others may work off of.
For git reset never reset commits that have been pushed to remote repositories.
For git push --force only use it when appropriate, use it with caution, and preferably default to using git push --force-with-lease.
